    ML-powered scene detection for optimal audio correlation timing.
    
    This class uses lightweight machine learning models to automatically detect
    scene boundaries and optimal segments for audio synchronization analysis.
    Designed to work efficiently on CPU without requiring GPU acceleration.
    
    The detector analyzes audio features across the video timeline and uses
    K-means clustering to identify distinct scenes that are likely to provide
    reliable audio correlation results.
    
    Attributes:
        video_obj: Video object containing media information and metadata
        n_scenes (int): Number of scenes to detect for correlation (default: 3)
        min_scene_length (int): Minimum scene length in seconds (default: 30)
        feature_cache (dict): Cache for extracted features to avoid recomputation
        detected_scenes (list): List of detected scene tuples (start_time, duration)
        
    Example:
        >>> detector = scene_detector(video_obj, n_scenes=3, min_scene_length=20)

        >>> print(f"Found {len(scenes)} optimal scenes for correlation")
